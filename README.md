VR flappy bird

Working on an Oculus compatible VR first person verson of the great known game flappy bird.

Currently working on:

Collision: Basic collision was setup. Player loses forward momentum when colliding and the ability to jump.

Menu: Have a basic menu setup, needs more functionality and design. Want to as well create an in-game start menu.

Models: Need to work on the models of the bird and the pipe as well as create an enviornment.

PipeSpawner: Currently have a script that spawns the pipes, need to increase the difficulty and figure out how to 
have pipes that can be longer so they are not just floating in the air.

Installation:
Download and then open up the scene in Unity, no built version yet. Make sure to turn open Oculus application for head tracking
to work.
